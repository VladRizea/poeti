The coldness so condensed into the air
The darkness’ thickness mother earth bears, 
Through winter’s sawdust winds are sharply slicing
In the pale void lightning bolts are dancing.

The clouds rest on snowflakes as on crutches
A vague contortion time in its net punches
The contours thicken, burning as they rise
Under the sea of lights with glassy eyes.

The colors are so frigid and deserted,
A downpour of metals, gray and sordid.
Large veils of indigo fall to the ground
Stoned by the breath of evening’s blue sound.

The time is so condensed into the air,
Infinity trapped in the word, I fare
To distant lands, my shadow wrestling,
In the pale void both of us are dancing.
