                      The aphasia
I stay between two idols and I cannot choose
none of them, I stay
between two idols and it is drizzling
and I cannot choose none of them
and during the waiting the idols remain
stock-still in the drizzling rain. I stay
and I cannot choose between two
pieces of wood, and it is drizzling and I cannot
in the rain rotten to choose. I stay,
and the woods, the two, show themselves
the ribs whitened by the drizzling rain.
I stay between two skeletons of horse
and I cannot choose none of them, I stay
and it drizzling, melting the earth
under the white bones, and I cannot choose.
I stay between two holes and it is drizzling
and the water is gnawing the earth with teeth
of starved rattle.
I stay with a shovel in my hand, between two holes,
and I cannot, in the drizzling rain,
to choose the first one that I shall plug 
with the earth bitten by the drizzling rain.
