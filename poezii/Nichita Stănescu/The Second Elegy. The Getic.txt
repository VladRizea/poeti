to Vasile PÃ¢rvan
In every hallow there was put a god.
If there was broken a stone, there was bring quickly
and put there a god.

There was enogh to be broken a bridge
to be put into the empty place a god,
or, on the roads, to rise a piece of asphalt, a hole,
to be put into it a god.

Oh, do not cut your hand or your leg,
by fault or by all means.

Immediatly they will put into the wound a god,
as anywhere, as everywhere,
they will put there a god
to bow him, because it
defends everything that separates itself from self.

Be careful, you, fighter, do not lose your
eye,
because they will bring and they will put you
into orbit a god
and it will stay there, hard-harted, and we 
shall move our souls glorifying him.
And even you will move your soul
glorifying it like the strangers.
